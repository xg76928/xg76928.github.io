            <p>Last summer, I had an internship in a local dance academy.Our academy was invited to a national talent competition of teenagers which was held by the China Central Television station. As a vice captain in the team, I had lead a group of dancers to Beijing. It was my first time in this position, as a real manager. I contacted several sponsors, reserved the hotel and managed the meals for our group. Even in the day of competition, I lead the group to the field and made sure that everything was going as planned, including makeup set up, clothing preparation, the song playlist. Our group won the second place in the competition and it was also the best experience from my past year. The experience was once in a lifetime, and made entertainment industry so much more attractive for me.</p>
